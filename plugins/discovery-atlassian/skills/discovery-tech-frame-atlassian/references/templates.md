# Template: Technical Brief (HTML+)

In Confluence as **HTML+** (`contentFormat: html`). A marker per section type -
see `references/confluence-style.md`. List items are described half-sentences
with the *why*, not keywords. Catalog ids come from the live source. Remove the
`{...}` hints.

Page title: `{prefix}Technical Brief`, where `{prefix}` is
`{Product name} | ` or nothing - the per-tree decision in
`references/discovery-rules.md`. The artifact words stay **English** so titles are
language-neutral; the page content follows the output language.

No meta preamble ("This document captures …"). The page opens with the
architecture; the functional context (the brief) sits in the page tree, a link
to it is superfluous.

## Output language - what to translate and what not

Render **all reader-visible text in the output language** (the user's
language): section headings (`<h2>`/`<h3>` text), status-chip labels, and prose.
The English strings below are the **reference meaning**, not literal output.

**Never translate** (leave verbatim): every `data-*` attribute,
`data-extension-key` and extension type, macro parameter names (`summary`, the
`details` and `excerpt` macros), `data-color` values, JQL/ids, the monoceros
CLI flags (`--template`, `--with-languages`, `--with-services`,
`--with-features`, `--with-mcp-servers`, `--with-ports`, `--with-repos`,
`--provider`) and command names (`monoceros init`, `monoceros add-repo`,
`monoceros list-components`), the yml keys of the plugin block, the
`language-shell` and `language-yaml` classes, URLs, and the page-title artifact word
(`Technical Brief`). Emojis are structural markers - keep them.

Rules:

- **Architecture at a glance** = the **named excerpt `summary`** (plain text, no
  panel). The architecture is the substance of the page and the transcludable
  summary at once - not a duplicate. **No meta intro** as an excerpt.
- **Building blocks and interfaces** = full width, one `<h3>` per part with a
  topic emoji, one sentence on its job and its counterparts. **From three parts
  up, a component diagram sits above them** (recipe in `confluence-style.md`):
  picture first, then the detail. It is an embedded PNG with the spec in a
  collapsed section below it, so the next run renders from the spec. The list
  stays authoritative, the diagram is the overview, and the page has to stand
  without it.
- **Technology decisions** = 2 columns (760), each `<h3>` with a **fitting topic
  emoji** (app-dependent, not fixed: e.g. ☕ Backend, ⚛️ Frontend, 🐍 mock
  service, 🔐 Auth, 🧬 vector DB, 🗄️ object storage, 🔗 integration) + `<p>`
  rationale **including the rejected alternative** in a clause, then a second
  paragraph led by a bold `{Must satisfy}:` carrying **one sentence** on what the
  decision is checked against. On an odd count leave the last column empty.
- **One decision, one cell**: heading, rationale, `Must satisfy`. Never two
  decisions in one column, or the two paragraphs can no longer be told apart.
- **The `Must satisfy` sentence is mandatory** and it is **one** sentence, not a
  list: the columns are 760 wide, and a list of three becomes five wrapped lines.
  Only what is checkable and only what belongs to this decision - what holds for
  every part is in the cross-cutting conventions, and what is about an entity, a
  role or a state is in the domain model.
- **The handoff line** sits in italics under the section heading, so the page may
  age without becoming wrong: this is the discovery-time state, later decisions
  are ADRs in the repository.
- **Operating frame** = full width, `<h3>` + `<p>`, **numbered squares in teal**
  before the title. Every entry names a constraint **and the decision it drove**;
  an entry that drove nothing belongs in the open points, not here. No catalogue
  of non-functional requirements.
- **Cross-cutting conventions** = 2 columns (760), one `<h3>` per convention with
  a topic emoji, **one line** each. Three to five, no more: they exist so that
  every story answers these questions the same way. With more than one subject
  area in the domain model, one of them is the **internal structure** (one
  module per area, only the owner writes, no circle, and the check by name).
- **Mapping onto the container definition** = flag→assignment in the
  **page-properties macro** (`details`), followed by the "Not in the yml" prose
  and **both** command blocks: the `monoceros init --template=…` sketch for a
  new workbench, and the `add-*` commands plus one `apply` for a workbench that
  already exists. Both always, labelled - the reader of the page may be in
  either situation, and the plugin hand-edit belongs with them as the yml
  snippet with the `ref` line and the Plugins docs link, never as a sentence
  alone. The `init` flags carry only what the template does not
  already bring. With a template other than `discovery-atlassian`, the line
  under the sketch names the defaults it lacked, and the yml block is there
  only when the plugin is one of them; with `discovery-atlassian`, neither
  appears under the sketch. The plugin snippet under the second block stays in
  every case. A component nobody has a file for yet stands in the table,
  marked so, and in neither block. The `create-template` line closes the
  section unless the sketch adds nothing to its template; its template name
  stays a placeholder for a new name, never the one the workbench started
  from (the command never overwrites a template). The table must sit inside the
  `details` macro: a bare table otherwise gets lifted unstably into a `<thead>`
  by the editor. (Even inside the macro the first row lands in `<thead>` -
  harmless on a one-time create, because in ADF it stays a header column
  `th`+`td`.)
- **Repos** = the skill asks whether a repo already exists. No repo → omit
  `--with-repos`, carry the repo as an open point. github/gitlab/bitbucket →
  full HTTPS URL in `--with-repos`. Another host → not in `--with-repos`, but
  `monoceros add-repo <name> <url> --provider=…` below it (ask for the
  provider). Under the code block, the docs link to the token setup.
- **Deployment** = **note panel** (`panel-note`). As long as undecided: a short
  "open" text - and the point then does **not** additionally appear in the open
  points (a section is the one place for its topic).
- **Open points** = 2 columns, each `<h3>` with a yellow `open` status chip +
  `<p>`. (HTML+ has no task lists - the chips are the substitute.) On an odd
  count leave the last column empty. **Only what is undecided about the
  product** goes here: a technology choice still open, a port to confirm, an
  unresolved external dependency, a repository that does not exist yet, a
  service or MCP server nobody has a file for yet (one point each: what it is
  for, where the file goes, the guide links, then the `add-*` command; never
  the file's content or an image tag).
  **Configuring a feature is never an open point** - no credentials, no token,
  no `.env` entry. That belongs to setting up the workbench, not to the product.
