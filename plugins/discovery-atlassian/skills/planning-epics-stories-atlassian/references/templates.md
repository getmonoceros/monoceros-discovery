# Templates: Epic, Story & Task (for Jira)

In Jira as **ADF**. Remove the `{...}` hints in the final version.

## Markup rules

- **References as ADF cards**, never as a raw URL or Markdown link. Prominent
  single references (journey on the epic, design screen on the story) as a full
  **`blockCard`**. Context references on the story (persona, journey, technical
  brief) as an **`inlineCard` with a bold label in front** (`Persona:`,
  `Journey:`, `Technical Brief:`).
- **Story to Epic via the Parent field**, not a generic issue link.
- **Epic label** `business`. There is no other epic label; the backlog has no
  architectural or technical epic.
- **Acceptance criteria as a checkbox list** (a real task list); Given/When/Then
  each on its own line, labels **bold and in color `#403294`**.
- Headings as real headings. The heading is exactly "Acceptance criteria", with
  no addition like "(Definition of Done)".
- Descriptions structured, not a wall of prose.

## Output language - what to translate and what not

Render **all reader-visible text in the output language** (the user's language):
issue summaries, description prose, section headings, and list items. The
English strings below are the **reference meaning**, not literal output.

**Never translate** (leave verbatim): Jira field names (Summary, Parent, Label),
issue-type keys, JQL, status/workflow ids, the label value `business`, ADF node
types (`blockCard`, `inlineCard`), the color `#403294`, any `data-*`/macro
identifiers, the BDD keywords Given/When/Then, and the artifact-type names
(Persona, Journey, Technical Brief, Epic, Story, Task).

## Epic - one per journey, lean

- **Summary**: {short, crisp title}
- **Label**: `business`

{One or two sentences of prose: the essence of the epic.}

{Journey as blockCard}

### {Acceptance criteria}

- [ ] {epic-wide criterion}
- [ ] {…}

---

## Story - one promised function, everything needed for it

As a {persona} I want {capability the persona can carry out afterwards},
so that {value}.

### {Business context}

A few sentences on the need behind it - enough that the business sense is clear
(not a one-sentence reference).

**Persona:** {persona as inline card}

**Journey:** {journey as inline card}

{If the story serves a second journey: that journey as a further inline card
with its own bold label.}

### {Implementation notes}

Plan as a list - everything needed so the persona can carry the function out,
across all layers. Whatever is missing for that belongs here:

- {Data: schema, migration, persistence}
- {Service: endpoint, validation, authorization}
- {View: the screen(s) the persona operates, states, keyboard use}
- {Delivery: routing, caching, headers - whatever the promise depends on}
- {Integrations: auth, storage, external services}
- {Edge cases}
- {Test level}

**Technical Brief:** {as inline card}

## {Design}

{The affected screen or prototype as a full `blockCard` (URL from the prompt or
asked from the user, tool-agnostic). This is the norm: a story a person operates
touches a screen. If the design deliverable has no screen for it yet, say so to
the user instead of dropping the section.}

### {Acceptance criteria}

From the persona's viewpoint: what they do, and what they then see. Not
"the response contains the address" but "the address appears with a copy
button". Given/When/Then bold and in color `#403294`, each on its own line:

- [ ] **Given** {initial situation}
  **When** {the persona does something}
  **Then** {what they can see or do afterwards}
- [ ] **Given** {…}
  **When** {…}
  **Then** {…}

## Task - work with no product function

For CI, licensing, repository settings and the like. No epic, no persona
sentence, no Given/When/Then.

- **Summary**: {what gets done}

{A few sentences: what is to be done and why it is needed. A short list of
concrete steps if that helps.}

{Technical Brief as inline card, if it is the source of the task.}
