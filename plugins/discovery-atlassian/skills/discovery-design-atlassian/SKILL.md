description: Derives the design brief for a product from the brief, personas, and journeys through a guided dialog - north star, brand personality, design principles, visual direction, key screens, interaction, and accessibility - and files it as a Confluence page under the brief. Use this skill when someone wants to work out the design direction, the design briefing, or the basis for a design system and a prototype. The design brief is the input for the subsequent generation of the design system and hi-fi prototype.

# Design Brief

You derive the **design direction** of a product from the brief, personas,
and journeys - as a design brief that then serves Claude Design (or Figma
Make) as the basis for generating a design system and a hi-fi prototype.

**Where this sits**: journeys → **design brief** → technical brief → planning.
You decide the shape of the interface here, and the technical brief decides
afterwards what it is built with, so this skill does **not** read the technical
brief. It comes **before** planning, which needs its deliverable: every story
that touches a screen references the prototype. A product with a user interface
needs this artifact.

**Two ground rules:**

- You **add** the design layer, you do **not duplicate** the product brief
  (problem and audience live there).
- You describe the **direction**, not the finished tokens. Colors, font
  sizes, spacing emerge only during generation. The design system is an
  **output** of the generation, not an input - so don't write a system
  here, write what it should be built from.

## Before you write anything

Read `references/discovery-rules.md`. It holds the rules that apply to every
discovery artifact; these three decide whether this skill's output is usable:

- **Invent nothing.** No requirement, property or condition of use that is not
  backed by the dialog or by an upstream artifact. When in doubt, ask; do not
  plausibly fill the gap.
- **Read the human's comments first** when the artifact already exists. Their
  comments are the work order, not your impression of the page.
- **Sections the human wrote are the calibration** for form, and they are not
  touched unasked. Propose a change and wait.

Findings that touch an upstream artifact do not get carried forward silently -
name them and work them in first (`discovery-rules.md`, "Feed findings back
upstream").

## Output language

Author the design brief - prose, headings, and labels - in the **user's
language**. Take it from the conversation, or ask once at the start if it
is unclear ("Which language should the design brief be written in?"). This
skill's own instructions and the template's technical markers stay as they
are; only reader-visible text is written in the user's language. See the
template for exactly what never gets translated.

## Principles

- **Keep it lean**, propose rather than interrogate, one topic at a time.
- **Described list items, not a keyword dump** - each point a half-sentence
  with the *why*.
- **Key screens fall out of the journeys** - one screen per important journey.
- **Feeling before values** - visual direction as a mood, not a color code.

## Procedure

### Step 0: Read the source documents

Read the brief, personas, and journeys (from Confluence, files, or pasted
in), and the domain model if it already exists (it names the things a screen
shows and lists). Summarize the intended feeling and the key journeys and
confirm with the user.

Do **not** read the technical brief. It comes after this one and takes the
platform decision from here.

**Existing design brief**: if one already exists, ask whether to update it
or create a new one.

### Step 1: Work section by section

Make a concrete proposal per section and let the user correct it.

1. **Design goal (north star)** - one sentence: which feeling/outcome the
   design must achieve.
2. **Brand personality & tone** - how the app feels and sounds.
3. **Design principles** - three to five, derived directly from the persona
   needs.
4. **Visual direction** - palette, imagery, typography, form as a mood (no
   final tokens).
5. **Key screens** - from the journeys, each with its task.
6. **Interaction & platform** - decided here, from the journeys and the
   personas (PWA, mobile-first, offline, one-tap actions). This is the section
   the technical brief reads afterwards.
7. **Accessibility** - contrast, touch targets, not by color alone.
8. **Brand & assets** - existing brand/assets or greenfield.

For real choices, use **AskUserQuestion**.

### Step 2: Confirm and check coverage

Check: does every important journey have a key screen? Summarize the design
brief and get confirmation.

## Finish: create the document

1. Read the template from `references/templates.md`.
2. Fill it. The last section **"What the generation should deliver"** records:
   design system as **tokens + components** and a **hi-fi prototype** of the
   key screens, **as code** (not Figma-only), so the Monoceros workbench can
   process it directly.
3. Create the document as an **HTML+ page** (`contentFormat: html`) **under
   the brief** (ask for the brief page as parent) or as a Markdown fallback.
   Format see below.
4. **Produce the finished generation prompt.** Read
   `references/generation-prompt.md`, replace `{{PRODUCTNAME}}` with the
   product name and `{{DESIGN_BRIEF}}` with the **full content** of the
   design brief **as readable text** (not the Confluence HTML+ markup -
   Claude Design reads prose, not macros). Output the result as **one code
   block** so the user can copy it with a single click.
5. Explain in one sentence: the design brief lives in Confluence; the user
   pastes this prompt into Claude Design (or Figma Make) to generate the
   design system and hi-fi prototype from it - the system *emerges* there,
   it is not an input.

### Format (HTML+) - rhythm, not a grid

Shared style rule: `references/confluence-style.md`. The design brief has a
fixed section skeleton, but **no uniform layout** - if every section looked
the same (2 columns everywhere, emoji everywhere), the page would become
unreadable. So: **each section gets a different treatment, never the same
one twice in direct succession**, the treatment fitting the content. The
approved layout (details + HTML patterns in `references/templates.md`):

- **Design goal (north star)** → **named excerpt `Summary`**, plain text,
  **no panel** (can be transcluded).
- **Brand personality & tone** → full width, `<h3>` + `<p>`, a **mood emoji**
  per trait.
- **Design principles** → 2 columns (760), each `<h3>` with a **topic emoji**.
- **Visual direction** → full width; the **palette with color chips** as a
  mini preview (chip colors roughly matching the palette), an italic
  disclaimer at the end ("direction, not final tokens").
- **Key screens** → full width, `<h3>` + `<p>`, **numbered squares in teal** (`:1_one_square_teal:` …).
- **Interaction & platform** → 2 columns (760), each `<h3>` with a **topic emoji**.
- **Accessibility** → full width, a blue **`Required` chip** before the title
  per requirement.
- **Brand & assets** → 2 columns (760), plain (no emoji).
- **What the generation should deliver** → **success panel**
  (`<div data-type="panel-success">`), `<strong>`-led paragraphs - the
  handoff into the build.
- Emojis app-fitting (not fixed). 2 columns uniformly `760`; on an odd count
  leave the last column empty.

## Style

- Propose rather than interrogate, one "why" sentence per decision.
